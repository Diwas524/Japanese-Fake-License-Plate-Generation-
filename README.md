# Japanese-Fake-License-Plate-Generation-
Japanese car number plates give information about where a car was registered and the classification of the vehicle.  The Chinese characters (kanji) of the town or city where the car was registered are displayed at the top of the plate followed by a hiragana character, and a serial number of 4 digits divided in to 2 sets of two numbers divided by a hyphen, with zero replaced by a dot.
